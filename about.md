**MSGalaxy**, a materials focused extension of the widely used Galaxy scientific workflow management system (SWMS). Our
vision is for MSGalaxy to become a unifying platform for the transformation of materials data into
materials knowledge through the integration of highly heterogeneous data sources and
computational/analysis tools in a manner that speeds up discovery and guarantees accessibility,
reproducibility and transparency of advanced materials discovery/development workflows.
